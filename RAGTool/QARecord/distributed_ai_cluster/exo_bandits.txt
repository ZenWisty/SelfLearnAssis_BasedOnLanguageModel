Any potential for a bounty for implementing function calling structured output? This would enable people who are using the Instructor library to use it with Exo

@Alex Cheema | exo  from pytorch pr, I am fixing the torch==2.4.0 but I also think it might come down to what version of CUDA the user has
this would require cuda 12.4
Alex Cheema | exo — 2024/10/7 09:32
hmm i wonder if someone already found a nice way to do this
Alex Cheema | exo — 2024/10/7 09:32
we can just make this a prerequisite when running with NVIDIA GPUs
with Apple Silicon, it works fine for me
vincent | t0kenl1mit — 2024/10/7 09:42
I think 12.4 cuda might be the most common too
Alex Cheema | exo — 2024/10/7 19:17

Hi guys, 

I wrote a fastapi backend to do performance analytics for exo so you can get better ring partitioning. It uses a statistical model called a dirichlet distribution to help search for optimal weight partitions, https://github.com/nikpocuca/exo-weights-api I kept it seperate from the repo for now.  Dirichlet distribution is a random variate on positive numbers that sum to 1.0. Which makes it perfect for weight partitioning. There's already a test in there for iterative schemes. Let me know what you think

Basically there's too many variables to account for proper weight partitioning becasue people may want different performance metrics. For example the weight partition distribution for optimal latency is not the same as optimal tokens per second. Also as the numbers of nodes in the ring increase, and different generative models start to be released we can just use analytics to find optimal partitioning instead of relying on hard-coded metrics like memory, and latency. 

 Ill be connecting it to a partition class for exo for https://github.com/exo-explore/exo/issues/284, and doing tests today and tomorrow

RockLee_8_gates — 2024/10/16 06:24
Hello @THeEmpire ,
I believe you're referring to the issue of compiling tinygrad to Swift (#238) . I'm currently working on this task. I've successfully implemented the functionality and am now in the process of integrating it into Exo's existing workflow. After that, I'll conduct end-to-end testing.
I welcome any discussions or suggestions on this topic. Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss it further. I'd be glad to exchange ideas and insights.

@Alex Cheema | exo idk what happened but when I do it on single computer it works but then I try two nodes and get gibberish... give me an hour ot two and I will fix this now
this is driving me crazy as it was just working
then I add in split model and things are breaking but this isn't even split modeling
vincent | t0kenl1mit — 2024/10/17 09:25

https://github.com/exo-explore/exo/issues/352 This work is perfect for me. I am familiar with Flutter, Dart, Python, and LLM inference tech. Flutter is an open-source framework for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications(windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android) from a single codebase. It has better performance and compatibility than Tauri. We can use Nuitka3 to package Python code into a C/C++ library, which can be called in Flutter with hybrid development technology. @Alex Cheema | exo

News from the pytorch inference engine development @ https://github.com/exo-explore/exo/pull/139

After more work and manipulating the safetensor files, it seems that this is grounded in how transformers works with large model loading. 

https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.21.1/en/main_classes/model#large-model-loading

It will load twice the size of the model into VRAM. For example, I shrunk down the 001 tensor for unsloth--Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct

Safetensor modified and saved to /home/t0kenl1mit/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--unsloth--
Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct/snapshots/4a5a8d99c8319f05d5230cbdccfb56fd0292532e/model-00001-
of-00004.safetensors
Initial size: 4.63 GB
Modified size: 1.38 GB


I then loaded the model and still ran into OOM issues even with modifying the model.safetensors.index.json to only load 1 layer

{
    "metadata": {
        "total_size": 1486897152
    },
    "weight_map": {
        "model.layers.0.input_layernorm.weight": "model-00001-of-00004.safetensors",
        "model.layers.0.mlp.down_proj.weight": "model-00001-of-00004.safetensors",
        "model.layers.0.mlp.gate_proj.weight": "model-00001-of-00004.safetensors",
        "model.layers.0.mlp.up_proj.weight": "model-00001-of-00004.safetensors",
        "model.layers.0.post_attention_layernorm.weight": "model-00001-of-00004.safetensor
s",
        "model.layers.0.self_attn.k_proj.weight": "model-00001-of-00004.safetensors",
        "model.layers.0.self_attn.o_proj.weight": "model-00001-of-00004.safetensors",
        "model.layers.0.self_attn.q_proj.weight": "model-00001-of-00004.safetensors",
        "model.layers.0.self_attn.v_proj.weight": "model-00001-of-00004.safetensors",
        "model.embed_tokens.weight": "model-00001-of-00004.safetensors"
    }
}


Using the newest version of accelerate and low_cpu_mem_usage=True did not help also

CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 1.96 GiB. GPU 0 ha
s a total capacity of 5.79 GiB of which 1.97 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, th
is process has 2.89 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 2.77 GiB is allocated by Py
Torch, and 1.95 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated.


With this method I think you are going to have to at least have double the VRAM for large models. One way I got it to work was to use device_map="auto" but that might cause issues for others. Going to test but will push the latest code with safetensor sharding soon

Essentially the model will load twice the modified safetensor no matter what 
Again, after I am done this, I am going full steam on writing a transformers like library but with a tinygrad backend because this whole transformers thing is bloated
I've read most of the transformers modeling source code and smh

Dan — 2024/10/21 00:44
The vast majority of people working on this repo are gonna be using one primary setup. This means that if you are developing against Macs, you are probably using MLX and not testing against linux. If you are developing on Linux with a GPU, you are probably using tinygrad and not testing anything in MLX. If linux and no GPU, then you are probably developing against torch.

I think that what would be helpful are some basic integration / smoke tests that can be run against a branch, just to check that everything is working, and that can be run with a simple command. For example, I run exo test --branch foobar --email foo@bar.com and it puts my branch on a queue and emails me when all tests pass, on all (basic) setups. The tests don't need to be extensive... it can be as simple as knowing that a basic command returns anything that isn't gibberish.

I would like to work on https://github.com/exo-explore/exo/issues/307 and I could use some pointers. I've been poking around chatgptAPI but I'm not exactly sure where/when to trigger the cancellation of process_prompt. Any suggestions are appreciated.

while looking, I did notice that exo defaults to smallest model in tinychat, but not with the API. I'm opening a PR for this right now

Alex Cheema | exo — 2024/11/1 06:41
It's actually quite involved since multiple machines are working on the request at a time.
bobfin21 — 2024/11/1 06:48
ok makes sense. Maybe we can start with working on getting the inference step to be cancellable? 
Would that be less involved?

Are there existing benchmarks for testing? Or I could create a small test suite. I am working on adding quantized models to tinygrad and would benefit from having a way to compare a bunch of models using different quantization methods
vincent | t0kenl1mit — 2024/11/1 21:29
Right now each inference engine has it own custom and standard inference engine test, standardizing it all would be good. Just need something you can plug an inference engine name in with model and test
sussik — 2024/11/2 02:41
yeah. I was thinking that plus having code to profile performance

@Alex Cheema | exo I have attempted:https://github.com/exo-explore/exo/issues/148
I tested it with the llama3.1-8b model e.g for the prompt "What is the meaning of exo? " 
I got 17963MB, 11605MB and 9507MB memory utilization with no quantization,int8 and nf4 respectively. I plan on running the same test with the 70B model once I have access to a larger machine. Do I need to run more tests before making the PR?

Yeah just took a look at his PR. Looks like it doesn't quite solve the issue - we want to support already quantized models.

sussik — 2024/11/6 19:22
Yeah, might be worth clarifying it on the issue. I think the tinygrad example is quantizing on the fly so I got tripped up. But Exo is building on top of tiny grad, not replicating it. My bad!

I would accept that payment in the form of an equivalent valued mac if you have any lying around too. I've only one computer that can run exo right now, so figuring out exo and getting iOS working on it is tricky 
roryclear — 2024/11/11 23:27
it can now
Alex Cheema | exo — 2024/11/12 00:02
So if I get this right, it can find the best kernel using tinygrad's BEAM or MCTS search that run on iOS?
roryclear — 2024/11/12 02:23
yeah, works the same way Metal's does
图片
If you want to try run it, it should just be a case of opening the iOS app, hardcoding the iOS device's IP address in ops_ios, and running tinygrad with IOS=1. Any weight files used will need to be copied into the xcode project too for now

Ok Idk what to do, I’ve asked twice now if there’s anything more I need to do for this bounty
I am quite confident I can get iOS nodes working for the next bounty but I do realistically need another Mac to do it. I’d rather not buy a new computer and do all the work only for this to happen again
Alex Cheema | exo — 2024/11/17 23:10
what device do you need to make progress?
can give ssh access to one of exo's devices
roryclear — 2024/11/17 23:22
for 238 I don't need anything, I've completed that as far as I know
roryclear — 2024/11/17 23:30
#352 iOS node bounty is separate, I would just need another mac on my local network to help with reverse engineering exo's networking, ideally I buy that with $500 from doing #238 but I don't know where that stands now
extra compute over ssh wouldn't help but thanks for the offer
roryclear — 2024/11/18 02:26
I've done this, just want to be paid (or told why not at least). I'm not starting another bounty if I'm not gonna get paid for either, especially one that requires me to buy new hardware.

Alex Cheema | exo — 2024/11/18 15:02
Of course. We've paid out $6K in bounties so far. ~Half of that was retrospective (i.e. bounties were awarded to recognise good work even though there was no explicit bounty). You will always be paid fairly for work you do on exo.

It's a little hard to track what the latest status is since there's no PR.
In the issue, the last thing you said was "I'm going to try also get this working with grpc and have iOS behave like any other device in tinygrad, rather than compiling everything before running"

The bounty states the following deliverables:

1. Swift or objc code generated from tinygrad running on iOS
2. A new InferenceEngine implementation in exo (Python) that can trigger the execution of models by executing the generated swift or objc code. This can be demonstrated on a Mac


I understand that the code for 1 is entirely in tinygrad so there won't be a merged PR for that (however creating a PR into your own fork's main branch would be helpful so I can leave comments). There should be a PR for 2 in the exo repo.
roryclear — 2024/11/18 21:09
yeah sorry, I've been updating progress on this discord instead of the github issue. I'll use that if preferred
I did what I said I would on the comment, only with requests instead of grpc
good idea on PR to my own fork, I didn't think of that. Here's one now https://github.com/roryclear/tinygrad/pull/1 I'll post on the issue too

Any plan to update the tinygrad version exo is using? My iOS stuff is forked from a more recent version of tinygrad which doesn’t work in exo right now
I can try doing this myself, there will be a free speed upgrade with it
Alternatively, I could rewrite the iOS fork based on exo’s tinygrad version, I'm not too keen on doing that though lol
Alex Cheema | exo — 2024/11/23 01:19
Seems much better to keep moving forward and get exo working with latest tinygrad
Will also award a $200 bounty for getting exo to work with latest tinygrad
roryclear — 2024/11/23 23:02
I tried this yesterday, fewer changes needed than I initially thought..
roryclear — 2024/11/23 23:12
iOS technically works on exo now if you use my fork in setup.py in that PR, as a tinygrad device though, not a node. So it replaces a machine in a cluster, if you got a slow computer and a fast ipad I guess it could already speed up inference
I was getting garbage outputs (after one good output for the first prompt) from llama yesterday on main when using tinygrad through exo instead of mlx, haven't looked into why yet 
larson_carter — 2024/11/26 10:03
I think it would be neat to see a bounty for docs. 

I mean detailed docs. If this is possible I’d like to be the maintainer of the networking section.

Alex Cheema | exo — 2024/11/26 16:42
yeah as we move towards a more interoperable protocol it makes sense to have docs for devs
right now it's very hard to build on top of exo in general so it wouldn't really help

I would appreciate that a lot.
larson_carter — 2024/11/26 18:17
I think a lot of people would. Seems to be a common issue
OKHand — 2024/11/26 21:03
I also agree that having detailed documentation for tasks like DEBUG or related development projects is important, as the most time-consuming part of debugging for me is reading all potentially relevant code files.

Currently, I don’t understand which type of functionality output each DEBUG level from 1 to 9 is defined for.

If I overlooked something, I apologize. Otherwise, I think it would be helpful to define which functionalities belong to each DEBUG level.

this is when the setup is broken.  Either a memory overlap, or something else incorrect. i’ve seen this many times before, but it rarely happens now, only if I’m reprovisioning the cluster or doing some other kind of complex stuff where not everything is synchronized.

Make sure to close all EXO instances, and then open them back up again.

Make sure you’re in a VENV, for each instance

This is my PR (https://github.com/exo-explore/exo/pull/475#issuecomment-2560588450).
I've tested and believe the MLX local model support is now implemented.

However, I encountered an unexpected issue during the process.
I initially attempted to follow the original approach: first downloading files such as token_config.json to establish the shard tokenizers, and then downloading the complete set of files before performing inference. This method, however, led to problems with the inference process.

Subsequently, I tried downloading all the files at once from the beginning, and this approach resolved the inference issues entirely.
I'm at a loss as to why this discrepancy occurs.

Therefore, I opted not to use the filter_repo_objects function for the local model implementation.
